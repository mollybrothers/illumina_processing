To get these scripts to mess around with yourself:
1. Fork this github repository by clicking 'Fork' on the top right
2. Clone your forked github repository from the command line by typing:
    `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY`
3. Now you can modify these files yourself and push/pull them to your own repository
